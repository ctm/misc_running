I may be able to get closer numbers on 3/27 if I re-use the zoom tool and make it tight

Missed a week due to hip/glute issues

Pretty poor, but better than last week when I only "ran" .20 miles due to my injury

 Still pretty poor, but overall 8.75 seconds / mile faster than last week, and my Saturday run was hardcore!

                                       8:11 was 41 seconds of 6:53, I misread watch and stopped early
 I was feeling pretty sick yesterday; Saturday was my first 24 mi 40# pack run of the year...
 ... still better than last week when I didn't do intervals at all; my hip/glute is giving me less trouble

 3/19 ... Not a normal place 5:35(1:15.0) ..................                                     6:28(1:15.0)
                                     Since this is 1/4 taper, it's not fair, but this is my best ^^^^^^^^^^^^

 4/ 4 7:06(1:15.0) 6:28(1:15.0) 5:52(1:15.0) 7:12(1:15.0) 7:45(1:15.0) 7:36(1:15.0) 5:52(1:15.0)

Wednesday, because I sprained my ankle on Saturday and wanted it to recover somewhat.  Additionally, this
was no breakfast, no calories, and my only caffeine was my double-espresso at 5:15.  Furthermore, I had the
equivalent of three beers the night before @ Taco Tuesday (Rio Bravo) w/ Team RWB.  Oh, and this was my first
time doing 12 intervals instead of 8.  I think weight loss and the potential for fat adaptation is *probably*
more important than improving VO2, so I'll definitely try another one of these "soon" (probably on Monday).
My speeds are disappointing, but if they get better and my weight continues to drop, I think that's probably
a win.

 4/ 9 7:19(1:15.0) 6:30(1:15.0) 5:53(1:15.0) 7:09(1:15.0) 7:57(1:15.0) 7:21(1:15.0) 6:04(1:15.0)

Monday again. Most times were worse than last Wednesday, but not all of them.  I did notice that my resting
HR was up about 10bpm this morning.  It was cool, so heat wasn't working against me.  I did experiment and
ate 1 oz. of dry nuts while doing my intervals.  I think next time I'll skip the nuts.  My ankle is still
slightly swollen, but I don't think that held me back.  Yesterday's bike ride wasn't very taxing, but I
also didn't eat much, so my being on a diet may be holding me back.  OTOH, I really do want to lose weight
"in the off season", so I'm willing to allow my performance to suffer at least a little bit.  Oh, and
yesterday was a core day and that may also affect me.  I have way too little data to know.

 4/18 6:52(1:15.0) 6:31(1:15.0) 5:54(1:15.0) 7:08(1:15.0) 7:38(1:15.0) 7:26(1:15.0) 5:58(1:15.0)

Wednesday, because I rolled my bad (right) ankle on Saturday and re-injured it, although not as bad as the
first injury.  Last night was Team RWB Taco Tuesday and I had three pints of normal strength beer.  I didn't
sleep well in part due to the beer, in part due to the cold. I continue to lose weight but I don't think I'm
losing performance.

Wednesday, because Saturday was Cedro 50k and I didn't feel fully recovered two days ago.  FWIW, I still
 have minor swelling in my right ankle.

 4/30 7:01(1:15.0) 6:24(1:15.0) 5:48(1:15.0) 7:02(1:15.0) 7:34(1:15.0) 7:19(1:15.0) 6:00(1:15.0)

Did two 32# pack runs up at Philmont during ESCAPE, 4/28 and 4/29, so my legs were still a little trashed.

 5/ 7 6:59(1:15.0) 6:33(1:15.0) 5:51(1:15.0) 7:29(1:15.0)                                        7:24(1:15.0) 7:10(1:15.0)
My sixth interval is a new one that is up Pony Express from our house.  I added it so that I could do 6.55mi
with six intervals as my 1/2 distance taper Monday.

 5/14 6:40(1:15.0)                                                                  5:28(1:15.0) 6:53(1:15.0)
1/4 taper.  These still aren't my best times, but they're pretty good for recent times.

 5/28 7:34(1:15.0) 6:45(1:15.0) 5:58(1:15.0) 7:17(1:15.0) 7:54(1:15.0) 7:31(1:15.0) 6:16(1:15.0)

Super slow due to CJ100 + BiH. Only did 8 intervals in the morning due to Memorial Day.

 6/ 4 6:57(1:15.0) 6:17(1:15.0) 5:49(1:15.0) 6:54(1:15.0) 7:26(1:15.0) 7:17(1:15.0) 6:09(1:15.0)

Roughly comparable to 4/25.  Obviously, I'm not fully recovered from CJ100, which isn't too surprising
considering that I did the Crest Trail hike (w/40# pack) on Saturday.  Considering I'm still losing weight,
I'm pretty happy with this performance.

Slightly better overall than last week, although much of that is due to my final interval being 16 seconds/mile
faster.  I expected to do worse, seeing how CM50k was a bitch.  OTOH, I didn't ride my bike or do anything else on
Sunday, so I did get an extra day of recovery.  Also, I had chia before and during this run.  I don't remember
if that was the case last week.

I had to actually sum all the differences to see that there was a very slight speed up (3 seconds per mile
averaged over 12 intervals, i.e. 0.25 seconds per mile faster) this week over last week,
but that's probably due to me taking two handhelds instead of one.  My legs were a bit more tired due to yesterday
being a 60 mile bike ride in warm weather, whereas the previous Sunday I didn't really do much due to the SAR
mission.

New intervals, done 30 seconds apart, the first one is the same as previous Monday intervals, but all the others
are incomparable.  Actually, the first one was done after 4.81 miles of jogging, so even it is not comparable,
especially since I started late today so it was hot. w/rests 2.67 miles @ 7:52, 151bpm

Same as last week in that I was doing all-outs for 75 seconds, then taking a 30 second break in between.  My
first interval starts at the same place, but successive intervals are a little further into the course due to
my being a little faster than last week. I started earlier and it was (probably) cooler than last week.  This
week I kept the starting point of each interval and each break fixed, so even if I ran a little short or long
on an interval or a break, I *tried* to start exactly on the time it would be if I had run or rested exactly the
right time.  However, 12 intervals with 11 breaks took me 20:40 but should have taken me 20:30, so somewhere I
screwed up the math.  Oh well. w/rests 2.72 miles @ 7:37, 152 bpm

Disappointing that I lost 2 seconds per mile in the intervals and 1 second per mile overall.  However,
I did the entire 13.1 miles in 2:09:26 this week (9:52 min/mile) @ 126bpm vs.
2:15:57 (10:22 min/mile) @ 122bpm.  This week's average temperature (according to the ambit) was 72.5F
and last week's was 70.2F and with the monsoons it was more humid this week.  So overall I suspect I gained
a little fitness even though my Saturday run was fairly long (35.8 miles, 12 hours on my feet) and I was
on my feet a couple hours juggling yesterday and then had the equivalent of four beers in the late afternoon.

12 intervals with 11 breaks took me 20:45, but should have taken me 20:30, so somewhere I screwed up.

It was very hot (started at 80F) and windy (20mph winds).  I also had lost two pounds since the prior day
which suggests I didn't have my glycogen stores topped off.  Not too surprising that this was my worst
set of intervals since I started doing them with 30 second breaks.
12 intervals with 11 breaks took me 21:00, but should have taken me 20:30, so I screwed up.  My third
interval should have been 1:15, but instead was 1:45.  I think my eleventh interval was also slow and/or
short.  I probably got confused there, too.  w/rests 2.64 miles @ 7:54, 146 bpm

It wasn't very hot or windy and I gained two pounds the day prior, so I would have thought I would have
done better.  I should have done 12 intervals with 11 breaks in 20:30, but instead I did them in 20:09
which suggests that I didn't get as much rest as I should have, considering all my times above are full
75 second intervals.  w/rests 2.63 miles @ 7:40, 156 bpm
Overall my 13.1 time was 2:08:22 which is a 9:47 pace @ 130bpm, a PR.  My previous best time was 2:09:26,
(9:52 min/mi) albeit at a 126bpm.  FWIW, I had two double espressos this morning and no chia in my
water.

The third line above uses 1:15.0 intervals for 10th and 11th even though I was only running hard for
1:00.0 on each of them.  Similarly, the second average includes those bad 1:15.0 intervals
I should have done 12 intervals with 11 breaks in 20:30, but instead I did them in 20:13, because I screwed
screwed up a bunch.  My pace for my third interval has a huge dip in it.  I don't remember why.  Looks
like my 10th and 11th intervals were 15 seconds short.

I got a late start due to fighting with Sophie.  As such, it was hotter (78.4F) and it was direct sunlight.

 8/13 7:01(1:15.0) 7:36(1:15.0) 5:54(1:15.0) Average: 6:50
Today was a taper day.  So, I only ran 1.45 miles (over to AA, up AA past the gate) before doing the
intervals (two uphill, then turnaround doing the rest and third interval down).  The third interval was
downhill in a place that I normally wouldn't be running downhill.  I didn't screw up, so my three
intervals with two breaks took 4:45, like they should. w/rests, 0.65 miles @ 7:21, 146 bpm
Overall my 3.69 mile time was 31:09, which was a 8:26 min/mile pace @ 124 bpm.  I have never done
this particular "course" before, since this is the first taper I've done since I switched to 75 second
all-outs with 30 second rests in between, so in that sense it's a PR.

      6:07(2:01.1) 6:42(1:03.2) Average of all eight: 6:36 
Skipped intervals last week, because I was in Denver, visiting Dave and Lauren.  This week I'm in my
taper again, this time for Tahoe 200.  I accidentally started too early and couldn't easily see my
watch, so I ran close to 1:30 for my first interval and since I sped up slightly at the end, and
since Movescount is a little wacky, my fastest pace was for a longer pace, which is why my first
interval is 1:27 instead of 1:15.

Since I was on my taper, I ran to my normal starting point, then ran 3 uphill, turned around and
jogged for my thirty seconds, then ran three downhill.  Because I wanted my overall HR to be around
130, I also did two other intervals, just for fun. One was the long downhill on the north side of
the AA loop.  The other was up San Francisco from Barstow to Buckboard.
w/rests, the first 6 were: 1.43 miles @ 7:22, 147bpm

 9/ 2 6:45(1:15.0) 7:24(1:15.0) 6:03(1:15.0) Average: 6:44

Although today is Sunday, I'm treating it as a Monday, because Tahoe 200 is a Friday start.
Today's taper was a repeat of 8/13. My three intervals with two breaks took 4:45, like they should.
w/rests 0.66 miles @ 7:11, 151 bpm
Overall my 3.68 mile time was 31:34, which was a 8:35 min/mile pace @ 129 bpm.
Today was cooler than 8/13.  That may explain why I was faster in intervals.  OTOH, I'm doing an
actual two week taper and was basically doing a one week taper on 8/13, so that too could contribute
to it.

Overall my 3.28 mile time was 30:42, which was a 9:21 min/mile pace @ 125 bpm.
I have minor discomfort in my left big toe.  I expect to lose a nail in a week or so.
I have greater discomfort in my right Achilles's tendon/calf.  I think that the way I'm
reintroducing running will work, although I'm a little nervous about my 1/4 marathon
distance pack run on Wednesday and the AA50k on Friday.

This was done in Gold Canyon, Arizona, before sunrise in drizzle.  I didn't have a headlamp, instead
I had an annoying hand-held flashlight.  This made it hard for me to see the time.  My seventh
interval was short due to me accidentally starting late (I think), which is why its time was
especially bad.

w/rests, 2.44 miles @ 8:22, 134 bpm -- Obviously I wasn't really pushing myself

Because I knew I had been running my intervals slowly, I decided to run the last mile as quickly
as I could.  Even then I was only able to get my average HR up to 148.  My time was 7:08.  My
legs are obviously tired.

Overall, my 13.1 time was 2:12:20, a 10:06 min/mile pace, but @ 119bpm.  Between recovering
from Mt. Taylor, the dark and the drizzle, I wasn't particularly motivated to try to get my
HR up to 130bpm.  I was happy to just get the intervals and mileage in and then get back so I
could drive out to see my dad.

This is my best Monday intervals to date.  That's probably because I didn't exercise at all on
Saturday or Sunday due to a combination of Balloon Fiesta and weather and today was very cool,
so I didn't have to carry a second water bottle and I didn't sweat much.

w/rests, 2.77 miles @ 7:24, 155 bpm

Overall, my 13.1 time was 2:04:08, a 9:28 min/mile pace, but @ 131bpm.  I overshot my 130 bpm
target early on and ran much slower after my intervals trying to bring it all the way back down
to 130, but didn't quite get there.

Twenty seconds per mile slower than last week, but last week I took Saturday and Sunday off, so
I would expect it to be better. than average and this weekend I ran a 50k on Saturday and a marathon
on Sunday, so I would expect it to be worse than average.  So, taking that into consideration, I'm
pretty happy with the numbers.

w/rests, 2.62 miles @ 7:46, 152 bpm

Overall, my 13.1 time was 2:07:07, a 9:41 min/mile pace, and this time at 130bpm.  So, last
week I was faster, but at a 1bpm higher HR.

Better than last time, but not my best intervals.  I did take Sunday off from exercise, which
probably helped me some.  It was also cool, yet bright, so that too helped me.  I did have a little
difficulty with the stoplight near AA's southern entrance; that slowed me down a tad.  However,
the big thing that probably held me back is that I did JJ100, another 50 miles of training, then
DPTR53M, so 203 miles in 8 days.

w/rests, 2.69 miles @ 7:38, 147 bpm

Overall, my 13.1 time was 2:03:46, a 9:26 min/mile pace, but my average HR was 122bpm, although
it looks suspiciously slow in the beginning and 126bpm might be a better average.  Either way,
it was well under 130.  I just didn't want to push myself that hard, since I had done DPTR53M
two days prior.

Super horrible times, but I ran a 50k fairly hard yesterday and today was below freezing with
very strong winds.

w/rests, 2.60 miles @ 7:51, 138 bpm

Overall, my 13.1 time was 2:01:18, a 9:14 min/mile pace, but my average HR was 124bpm, but that
includes some suspiciously low portions.  However, I spent about five and a half minutes pooping
under the bridge by the intersection of San Antonio and Wyoming.  I had sufficient GI distress
that I couldn't make it to the McDonald's.  I was going to poop my pants if I tried, so I ducked
under the bridge.  It was below freezing and there was quite a strong wind, so I had trouble
with my drawstring and also had cold hands for the remainder.

========================================================================

Starting on November 19th, I began doing my interval training while wearing my forty pound
pack.  As such, all the numbers are much slower.

                   ^stoplight

My best average is 6:46, which is 87 seconds per mile faster.  Since
the extra weight should add about 80 seconds, I'm in the ballpark,
especially considering the stoplight that consumed about 30 seconds of
my time on my eighth interval.

w/rests, 2.34 miles @ 8:43, 144 bpm.  Since my best w/rests is 7:24
min/mile, this is very good, considering I did my 7:24 @ 155bpm.

Overall, my 13.1 time was 2:09:36.5, a 9:53 min/mile pace, with a 130bpm average HR.  It
was 24F when I started and 38F when I finished.

      8:26(0:45.1) 13th a bonus stub, got confused
Ugh!  I fell twice during today's run, once before I started the intervals, once on my sixth
interval.  As such, only my first five intervals can be compared.  I've written down the
other ones, just for reference.

FWIW, I first fell, 3.59 miles in.  Today I got there in 36:00.4 and that was after
a 27.6 second pause at a stoplight.  My reported average HR was 101.  Last week I got to the
same distance in 36:08.8, but with no stoplight pause and my average HR was 113.  My *guess*
is that if I hadn't fallen at all that I'd have turned in a faster overall time than last
week. To some extent speculation doesn't really matter, 'cause I did fall twice.  However,
there's an outstanding question of how hard my four mile race on Friday and my thirty two
mile run on Saturday affected me today.  I don't think that combination could have significantly
hurt me based on those first 3.59 miles.

Today's Pauses:

  27.6 stoplight crossing over Harper to AA
  17.7 on the ground after first fall
  26.1 on the ground after second fall
  44.7 stoplight at AA south gate
  46.4 stoplight at AA west gate
5:07.0 stopped tying shoe, mixing Tailwind
_____
7:48.5 total time stopped

2:08:07.9 moving time

Last week's Pause:
  23.4 stoplight at AA south gate

2:09:13.1 moving time

So, based on moving time alone, I also did better, although that can favor a run with more
stopping due to the ability of the body to recover while being paused.  Today, however, I
think my body took more trauma from hitting the ground (twice!) than it gained by the almost
eight minutes of pauses.  OTOH, I'll never really know.

In theory, I'll do significantly better a week from today, assuming similar weather and I
catch lights OK.

Did a bonus interval because I wasn't counting them and am still used to how far I got before I
started doing them with my pack.  As such, I am computing stats for both the first 12 (so
I can compare to two weeks ago) and all 13.

12 intervals
w/rests, 2.34 miles @ 8:43, 148bpm, 20:30.1

13 intervals
w/rests, 2.55 miles @ 8:43, 149bpm, 22:15.1

Overall, my 13.1 time was 2:14:11, a 10:13 min/mile pace, with a 134bpm average HR.  It
was 19.2F when I started and 30.9F when I finished.  In theory, this is worse than two
weeks ago, however, I believe my HRM read low for about the first twenty minutes two
weeks ago and that allowed me to run at a faster HR for the rest of the run.  Additionally,
it was sufficiently cold that I had to mess around with my fingers in my gloves quite a
bit and that raises HR.

12 intervals w/rests 2.36 miles @ 8:39, 152bpm, 20:29.8

Overall, my 13.1 time was 2:25:36, an 11:06 min/mile pace, with a 132bpm average HR.
It was 29.7F when I started and 38.7F a half hour after I finished (I forgot to check
when I got back).  These are my best intervals with my pack so far, but my overall time
was high due to me having a chest cold.  That meant that my HR was higher than it would
normally be.  In fact, on my first interval the slightly rasping sound my lungs were making
was a little disconcerting.  I think I benefited from not having exercised at all yesterday,
but that still didn't make up for the cold.  As such, assuming I shake this cold, I expect
to make even better progress next week.

I have a chest cold, but decided to run anyway.  I did not exercise on
Friday or Sunday due to my cold, but I did do my La Luz pack run on
Saturday and my pack interval run today.  In both cases I knew my
performance would be decreased due to the cold and I also figure that
I won't recover from the cold as fast as I would if I totally stopped
exercising, but it's a trade-off.  I'm exchanging a little longer to
return to full health in exchange for a chance to continue making
progress in training.  I'm not convinced it's the right thing to do,
but I think it's more likely than not.

12 intervals w/rests 2.39 miles @ 8:36, 155bpm, 20:30.8
13 intervals w/rests 2.59 miles @ 8:35, 155bpm, 22:14.8

Overall, my 13.1 time was 2:09:34, a 9:53 min/mile pace, with approximately a 143bpm average HR.
It was 36.5F when I started and 44.2F when I finished.  My intervals were just barely better
than last week.  I was healthier, but I also ran harder before the intervals started and it was
warmer.  I was also .6 pounds heavier today than last week.

FWIW, I was pretty sure my thirteenth interval was a bonus, but I chose to do it anyway because
I was feeling pretty good and I also was planning on having a fairly quick overall time.  My
reason for running hard in the beginning is that my HRM was acting up and I knew that my initial
HR was sufficiently high that I couldn't play my usual game of trying to get an exact 130bpm
average.  I will change the battery "soon".

12 intervals w/rests 2.41 miles @ 8:28, 153bpm, 20:30.1
13 intervals w/rests 2.64 miles @ 8:28, 153bpm, 22:14.9

Overall, my 13.1 time was 2:18:52, a 10:36 min/mile pace, with approximately a 133bpm average HR.
It was 29.5F when I started and 43.9F when I finished.  I was ostensibly 2.8 pounds heavier
today than a week ago, but I weighed myself and had my oatmeal before I big poop, so I was
probably less than a pound and a half heavier.

I stopped logging my intervals after I wrote "nom_fun", which extracts the
intervals for me.  Since I hadn't added as many stats as I used to
compute by hand, I figured I wouldn't update this file until I added them
in.  Well, I can no longer remember which date gave me my best stats, and
I'd like to know that so I can compare today's (20190211) taper interval
against my all-time best, so here is a dump of the intervals since 12/24.

Without pack, but after a morning where I ran 1 AA lap then back to
the house to poop, then came back and ran an AA lap and an extra mile
before running the intervals.  All told I wound up doing 15.42 miles
(close to my new normal 15.50 Monday miles), with the intervals as the
first part of my final AA lap.  My GI distress was due to a
combination of me doing a low fiber Saturday in preparation for Run
for the Zoo on Sunday as well as celebratory eating and drinking after
RFTZ.

The funny thing is that @ RFTZ, my average pace was 7:25 according to
my Ambit 3 (and 7:27 according to the chip timing), which basically
shows that by doing my intervals when I'm doing them (i.e., as my
fourth and final AA lap), I'm probably not getting anywhere near as
fast as I would if I were doing them after a brief warm-up on a day
after a rest day.  OTOH, I don't think faster intervals are as
important as high volume for HR, but I do think the intervals help.

Without pack, and only the second time I've done my intervals at the
end of a 15.5 mile run, even though that has been my *intent* for the
last few weeks (pooping has gotten in the way).  Today was my fastest
15.5 miles @ *approximately* 130bpm so far.  The whole thing averaged
9:21 min/mi, 132bpm.

So, although I only improved by .7 seconds a mile, my legs had more
immediate mileage on them before starting the intervals than ever
before.  I also wound up starting *right* on the road into the east
entrance to AA (i.e. I started as far west as I ever do, which meant
slightly more uphill).  OTOH, compared to last week it was cooler
simply because I got to the intervals earlier in the day.  It was not,
however, particularly cool.

Kind of hard to interpret today's intervals, because I doubled up on
the caffeine and didn't have breakfast.  I chose to do it that way
because I ate weird yesterday due to the Santa Fe Century and ate
weird the day before due to the SAR mission and ate weird the day
before that due to ESCAPE.  This morning I was really afraid I
wouldn't be able to do my entire run w/o having to return for a potty
break, but I figured if I skipped breakfast, and then had a second
dose of caffeine and waited around, I might be able to get through it,
and I did.

The weather was slightly (1.5F on average) cooler than last week, but
there was more humidity in the air.  I think the extra humidity was
cooling, but it's hard for me to say.  Normally my "big" weekend
effort is on a Saturday and I relax by riding my bike on Sunday.  This
past weekend, my "big" effort *was* a bike ride and it was on Sunday,
so my legs didn't have the extra day to recover, but I did not ride my
bike anywhere nearly as hard as most of my big Saturday efforts.

My second hand hit a fifteen second start a little later than last
week, so I started slightly further uphill.  I haven't previously
tried to analyze how much of a difference that makes, but when I took
a poke just now it appears that the logging granularity is too course
for me to get a feel for how much time or distance elapsed.

Oh, and I didn't sleep particularly well last night due to the
caffeine and perhaps even a little due to the jalapenos I ate as part
of my post-ride meal @ SFC.

These were done on a Friday, because I didn't run on Monday due to
still being tired from JMTR50M.  I didn't do intervals on Wednesday,
because I chose to do a speed 5k pack run in preparation for the
Believe in Heroes ruck 5k, but I used my Trekker and wasn't really
able to run as fast as I should have due to bad resonance.  So, my
compromise was to do 12 intervals on Friday (the day before BiH5k),
but in the middle of a 5.6 mile (i.e., from home, to AA, one lap
around AA and back) 35# pack run, using George's pack, which I also
borrowed for BiH.

Forgot to have breakfast, even though that was my tentative plan for
today.  Chose to take a double espresso to have after my second AA
loop, so it would have about a half hour to kick in before I started
my intervals.  A guy driving out of AA didn't immediately stop at the
stop sign even though I was running right toward him.  He saw me and
suddenly slammed on his brakes (and luckily didn't get rear-ended; my
guess is the person behind him saw me), but that prevented me from
starting my interval when/where I had planned, so I waited for the
next increment of 15 seconds to hit before I started.

Today was *hot* (74.5F when I finally got home).  I had to ration my
chia-seed water.  I think skipping breakfast probably held me back,
especially since I went down 1.7 pounds from yesterday morning to this
morning in part due to my messed up eating schedule due to me
misremembering when the Team RWB Leadership meeting was being held.

I expected to make gains, considering I didn't really do much over the
weekend (although I do admit that BiH was intense, even though brief),
but today was the first Monday where it started out warm and sunny and
just got warmer.  When doing 11.5 miles before my first interval, heat
is probably a big factor.  My guess is my body got some good stress
though and will make some useful adaptations.

Big change this week.  Did intervals before any laps around AA, then
chose not to do any more laps around AA.  W/o Hardrock looming, I'm
de-emphasizing mileage and trying to up speed and heat tolerance.

I accidentally ran my 8th interval for only 60 seconds, so the 6:55.3
is much slower because it includes fifteen seconds of rest.  It was a
downhill interval, so it should have been closer to 6:25.  However,
that means that my intervals after that were all done in a slightly
less taxed state, so I can't just subtract 2.5 seconds (30 seconds /
12 intervals) off my overall average.

FWIW, when I run my interval averaging app against my July 2nd, 2018
GPX file I get "Average: 7:06.7", which is more than a couple seconds
per mile slower than what I hand calculated last year (7:04) and gives
me a three second per mile improvement over last year.  However, there
were four notable differences between last year's run and today's:

  1) I had run a lap around AA last year before I did my intervals
  2) It was slightly cooler last year
  3) I only had one hand-held last year
  4) The day before I did a two hour leisurely bike ride, rather than
     a relatively tough one hour ruck run.

Bottom line is I don't think today's interval training shows that I'm
significantly more or less fit than I was one year ago.

Today's interval training started after one AA lap. I didn't have any
non-caffeine calories before or during, and it was muggy, although a
fairly consistent 75F.

I'm in a rush, so this is the output from int_ave as I left it last time
I was experimenting with it.  The fudges that I've removed don't change
the paces, but they can change which 75-second spans were chosen as
intervals.

TODO: use fantoccini to scrape all the dates that I mention in this file
and then run a "good" version of int_ave over all of them.

Ugh.  Worst intervals in a long time.  I hope that's due to me doing them in

Decided to do intervals on a Wednesday, two days after previous
intervals.  I'm going to try this next week, too.  I would normally be
doing pack runs on Wednesday but I haven't even sent my Rucker 20L
back yet, and I'm still recovering (I think) from some hip issues.
Anyway, today was a small step up from two days ago, which is pretty
good since I didn't sleep well last night (repeated SAR calls, but I
can't attend the mission due to my truck being in the shop) and my
late start and the consequent heat.

Ugh.  A firmware update has my QNap sidelined.  For whatever reason, I
hadn't pushed Monday_Intervals in a while, so I don't have my notes
for the various dates I ran them.

My training since the beginning of June has been pretty poor.  I know
I've been embarrassed by my injuries and performance, *but* I did
manage to BQ @ Cottonwood. Furthermore, this many days after BQ'ing @
Tucson in December 2017, I had a bunch of junk in my lungs from either
a bad cold or the flu.  So in one respect I'm doing much better than
last time.

My interval stats two days ago were absolutely horrible, although
IIRC, I started off on the wrong foot (so to speak) by running my
first interval longer than 75 seconds and then simply shortening my 30
second rest.  So, it's nice to see significant improvement two days
later, but 7:42 is still pretty bad.  Last year, the Monday before
Mt. Taylor 50k, I was at 7:11, and I ran the entire 13.1 mile training
run at a 9:45 min/mile pace @ 130bpm.  Today, the 13.1 was 11:16
min/mile @ 130bpm.

I don't think I'm fit enough to want to enlist a pacer or crew to help
me beat 20 hours @ JJ100 this year.  After getting close last year w/o
crew and pacer I figured I could simply knock the eleven minutes off
my time by adding support, but now the race is close enough that I
think that it's an unrealistic goal and that I should simply be happy
with whatever time I get and just take it easy to be as recovered as
possible going into BMDM training in mid November.

These 10/21 stats aren't that good, but I did run the Duke City
Marathon as the five hour pace group leader (in 5:00:19) yesterday and
did "run" the Sandia Crossing Marathon (5,600 ft. gain, dodgy footing,
higher altitude and I stopped to chat with people and to drink a pint
of beer) the day before in 7:24:30.  Last year my average was 7:10.5
the day after DCM, which was the day after the White Mesa Fat Ass 50k
(which I ran in 6:45:54, but only had 4,600 ft. gain, fairly good
footing and no distractions).

I'm definitely not as fit as I was a year ago. I should, however, be
able to run JJ100 sub-24 w/o any distress.  I think going sub-20 is
exceedingly unlikely, although it does look like it might be a
relatively cool year.  I don't think sub-20 is sufficiently doable to
merit trying to scare up a crew and one or more pacers, especially
with me being on a tight budget, so I'll have to leave that for next
year.

Today I chose to run my intervals within only one AA lap, so all told I
ran 5.56 miles instead of 13.1.  Last year on the Wednesday between DCM
and JJ100 I didn't run at all, because of a combination of the weather and
my catching a flight to PHX.  I wanted to do more speed work today, but
decided 13.1 miles was perhaps a bit too much this close to JJ100.

Unfortunately, I forgot when I was supposed to stop running on my 
eleventh interval, so I in between a 7:51 and a 7:40 I posted an 8:20.
To make up for it, I ran 13 intervals total (deliberately this time).

So, even w/o the extra 3.3 miles before, I'm still not particularly
fast when doing my intervals, but I believe at this point it's
basically due to the fitness that I lost when I was injured rather the
injury itself holding me back.

Last year, my average was 6:54.2 on the Monday after Deadman Peaks 53
miler, so I'm 28.6 seconds slower than last year, which isn't
suprising but is a little annoying.  Oh well, at least I have plenty
of room for improvement.

========================================================================
Was 8 seconds past the top of the minute when I crossed the earliest
spot I start my intervals.  Decided to jog for 52 seconds uphill
instead of only 7, so I started at :00 instead of :15.  That helped me
remember when to start, rest and stop, but it did give me less uphill
which surely helped my stats.

FWIW, my interval stats are better than a year ago, but in addition to
the shorter uphill, last year I ran the Ghost Town 50k the day before
my intervals, rather than the WMFA 50 two days before.

The big experiment is coming up in that I'm going to alternate pack
and non-pack intervals starting my first pack intervals of the
training season a week from today.  Last year I switched to pack
intervals every Monday while in the serious portion of my BMDM
training and I think that was too much.

Today was my first 40# 13.1 mile interval training since February
25th.  I experimented with having three slices of bread instead of
oatmeal pre-run, but then I spilled some cous-cous in our bread
cabinet and while cleaning it I found a few old stale small tortillas,
both corn and flour, so ... I ate them.  Then, right before leaving I
decided to have two gels.  I don't think I gained any power or stamina
by all of that.  I suspect I lost some speed, however, the valve on my
bladder didn't work, so after I went through my first two 20
oz. bottles of water, I couldn't get more water, so I was parched at
the end, especially with the temperature getting up to 55.8F at the
end.

So, last year, 2018_11_19: Average: 8:14.7
               2019_02_25: Average: 7:54.4

Being down 21.2 seconds/mile from last year at this time isn't
horrible, considering how much fitness I lost due to injury in my
off-season, especially considering the temperature difference (last
year the average by my Ambit3 was 51.6F, this year 61.9F, although
that could be skewed by my lack of water slowdown at the end).

It will be interesting to see if the various tweaks I make during this
year's training will allow me to catch up to where I was last year by
race day.

Done without a pack. This is my best time since June 3rd (technically,
I ran faster intervals on July 1st, but I didn't run as far before I
started the intervals, so it doesn't count), although it's only
slightly better than 11/11, and on both that day and today I started
fairly high up the hill due to needing to get to :00 to start.

I walked with Roy a bunch of time after I had done my intervals, so my
overall 13.1 mile time wasn't particularly quick, but my first 9 miles
averaged a 9:08 pace, which is pretty good.

Still, I'm hoping to get back under 7:00 as I continue my BMDM
training.

I chose not to run at all Monday 12/2/2019.  I had a quad espresso in
the morning, but that didn't really wake me up.  The Bosque Boogie 50k
took *much* more out of me than I expected.  Slipping and sliding as
well as carrying around a bunch of extra mud (weight!) on the bottom
of my shoes wound up using muscles in different amounts than normal.
I'm not the most efficient runner by any means, but I'm still *much*
more efficient when running that course mud-free than I was on
Saturday.

Oh yeah, and I fell and hit the ground once during that run, too.  I
think I tripped on the same stump I did last year (or the year
before).  It's toward the end of the first loop, right as we have to
go slightly to the left before we have to go under the Montano bridge.
There's about a four inch diameter stump that sticks up about an inch
that is easy to overlook when the sun is still in the east. *MAYBE*
I'll remember it next year.

I still felt guilty not running on Monday, but at least I don't appear
to be getting a cold, and my Wednesday (12/4) speed pack run went
fairly well.

========================================================================
Ugh!  I wound up getting called out on a SAR mission last night and my
pack got completely discombobulated, in part due to proper use but
also due to me losing my keys and then pulling everything out of it.
Furthermore, lots of stuff got wet slightly because I made a mistake
with the Jet Boil and introduced a tiny amount of snow into my pack,
but mostly because I volunteered to lug the subject's frozen pants and
frozen shoes in my pack.  So ...

... I got back home, brought everything in from the Sienna, had
breakfast and a very strong beer and decided to count my SAR mission
as my exercise, even though it was only vaguely comparable.
========================================================================
Without a pack and on a Tuesday after core exercises, but with only
one bottle of water and only a half a brick of tempeh and a green
drink as calories since 5pm yesterday evening.

Tuesdays are supposed to be rest days, where I only run 8.9 miles at a 130bpm
HR, but due to the SAR mission I missed doing intervals yesterday which made
two weeks in a row, so I decided to compromise and run 8.9 miles but add my
intervals to it.  Since it was only going to be 8.9, I chose not to run with
calories in my water, but once I had done my second lap I decide that if I
felt good after doing my intervals I'd run the third lap and the loop around
the block that brings it up to 13.1, which is what I did.  My average HR was
135 after doing intervals so rather than run super slowly to try to bring my
total average HR to 130, I chose to run faster than normal to see if I could
finish my 13.1 with an average pace faster than 8:00 min/mi, which I did:

13.12 miles, 1:57:12.5, 8:56 min/mi, 137bpm average HR

At this point I think I'll do all my 13.1 mile or less non-pack runs w/o
calories, but I'll still use calories on my pack runs.

Since today was not a pack run interval training session, I'll use my
pack a this coming Monday.  Normally I don't do that after a Bosque
Bike Path Saturday pack run, but due to a Cibola SAR evaluation, I'm
doing my Bosque Bike Path pack run this Friday anyway.

Although these are my best numbers since 10/15/2018, I did start
further up the hill than most times.  I crossed the driveway across
Albuquerque Academy at about 8 seconds after the top of the minute.
There was too much sun and traffic for me to have tried to hurry
across fast enough to start a minute earlier, so I ran *very* slowly
those 52 seconds to the top of the minute, but that still put me
further up the hill.

Oh, my rest between intervals 10 and 11 was 45 seconds instead of 30
due to a stoplight at the western entrance to AA.  I made up for it by
taking only a 15 second rest between intervals 11 and 12.

With 40# pack.  Was supposed to be 13.1 miles, but I had to cut it
short *after* I did my intervals, due to potentially explosive GI
distress.  Nice improvement over 11/18, especially since I'm getting
over a bad cold or mild flu.  My suspicion is that my GI distress was
due to the residual effects of my sickness, although the way I
staggered my caffeine may have contributed, too.

Last year on 12/17, my average 8:03.4, but I had a chest cold.  Today
I had very little in my lungs and basically felt great, but as
recently as Thursday evening I skipped two social activities due to
sickness and my Friday 18 mile 40# pack run was definitely slower due
to sickness, so ... I'm happy with the progress I'm making and hope I
can sustain my momentum.

Oh, and I started further down the hill than usual, *before* the AA
driveway.  I normally don't start my intervals that early, but there
was no traffic and I didn't want to travel up hill for almost a minute
before starting.  So that makes my stats a little better than they
appear.

With 40# pack.  Was supposed to be 13.1 miles, but I stayed up late
last night bug chasing, then did some more bug chasing in the morning
and decided to see what would happen if I skipped breakfast and only
had espresso until I started drinking my Tailwind (at 9:45, 17 hours
and fifteen minutes after my previous calories (4:30pm)).  Well ...
by the time I had done my first AA lap and had to turn around to start
doing my intervals I was considering just going home, because I was
definitely out of gas.  And after I did my intervals, I did go
straight home, so I only did 8.9 miles (at least so far today).

I started further up the hill than last time, so my .6 seconds/mile
improvement is really a decrease, but I do think that not eating
slowed me down considerably.  I still coughed up small amounts of junk
from my lungs, but nothing at all like on Wednesday (during the
Foothills Fat Ass 50k without a pack).

With 40# pack.  I did do 13.1 miles, although I walked a lot after
doing my intervals and even went inside my home for a potty break at
12.2 miles.  I had my green drink before running and too much liquid
in me made things uncomfortable, albeit *after* my intervals.

Considering how much I had to eat yesterday and this morning and that
I once again wound up starting fairly far up the hill, I'm
disappointed that I only made a 7.7 secs/mile improvement.  *However*,
my first interval was a sub-8 minute mile up hill, and I think that
really cooked my legs.  I did a 7:54.4 on 2/25/2019 and I *think*
that's my best.  Last year, my interval average on 1/14/2019 was
7:46.3, *but* I only did 11 intervals, probably because I hadn't
learned to count back then.

FWIW, counting is hard when I'm doing intervals, so now I *always*
start on 0 seconds past the hour and I also shift my bottles back and
forth so that on odd numbered (starting at 1) intervals my "good
bottle" is on my right hand and on the evens it's on my left.  That
helps me remember when to start and when to stop.

No pack today after all.  An important clip broke on my descent down
La Luz on Saturday.  I have a new Tioga coming on Wednesday, so I
decided to do a non-pack interval training today.  I'll then defer my
Wednesday speed pack run to Thursday, which may slightly interfere
with my performance at Saturday's snowshoe race, but oh well...

This time I actually ran back slightly before starting my intervals,
because my watch hit zero seconds after the minute before I got to my
earliest starting spot.  In the past I've jogged very slowly up from
there, but a minute is a long time and that puts me further up the
hill, so this time I doubled back and got almost back to the AA
driveway before turning uphill and starting again.  I will do that
from now on so that I'll essentially be starting from close to the
driveway every time.  It's embarrassing that I didn't start doing that
earlier, although I used to pay more attention to my total 13.1 mile
time than I do now.

With 40#, started just before crossing the driveway into the north end
of AA, which is *slightly* earlier than I'm supposed to start, but
there were no cars and I really didn't want to run in place for a
minute waiting to get to 00 seconds past the minute again.

Although I started at 00 and was switching water bottles, I still
screwed up.  Looking at my pace graph on Movescount it appears I
started my sixth interval late.  I *think* I then ended it when it
should have ended and that I did 30 second rests in between each of
my remaining 75 second all-outs, but the damage had been done and I
knew I had lost count, so I did what I *thought* was an extra
interval, just to be sure, but it turns out I had done two extra
intervals.

Considering that I got behind on sleep (due to the SAR mission) and
that all the caffeine both Saturday (Snowshoe Race) and Sunday (Bombs
Away ARR Burque Brew Tour race) and that this was my first interval
pack run with my new Tioga, I'm not too unhappy with my numbers.

My hope is I actually got better training and am a little more fit
than the numbers suggest.  I'll know more after my Wednesday speed run.

Much hotter today than a week ago.  I also was carrying around extra
food in my gut due to a combination of having done a low fiber
protocol on Friday and eating like a piggy yesterday evening (after
having gotten myself amped up over a SAR mission that was over well
before I got to IB).

I did, however, successfully count to 12.

Once more I successfully counted to 12.  Yay.

Today there was light rain, so although I did my normal lap around AA
before doing my intervals, I went straight home afterward, for a total
of 8.88 miles instead of my typical Monday 13.1.  FTR, rain doesn't
hurt me, but it does potentially hurt a Tioga 5500.  I've worn through
clevis pins in the past.  Since I'm down to one functional pack that
I'm using both for SAR and BMDM training, I really didn't want any
additional strain on it.  As it is, I didn't go to a SAR mission in
Santa Fe last night due to my pack being too poorly organized for me
to count on it in the dark in a storm on the mountain :-(

As per last year (2019_02_18), I ran to AA and did 6 intervals w/o
doing my normal one lap prior or one lap after, for a total distance
of 5.56 miles.  However, last year I did an additonal mile after I got
home so that I did one quarter marathon distance.  This year I had
glanced at what I did last year and wanted to do the same, but I
didn't pay close enough attention to see that extra mile, so I didn't
do it because I didn't think I had done it last year.

It was about 10F warmer today than last year.  My average interval
pace was 23 seconds / mile slower than last year.  Some of that was
the heat, but most of it is simply me being less fit.  The portion of
my back that chafes is now tough enough that it didn't slow me down.

Nice improvement from last week.  Still, 24.9 seconds/mile slower than
last year, although it was about 11F hotter this year than last.  My
overall pace for the 13.1 miles this year was 10:19 @ 142bpm,
vs. 10:06 @ 142bpm last year.  However, I was wearing my ice hat this
year, so that may have been a contributing factor.  Also, last week
since I only did 6 intervals, the percentage that were uphill was much
greater, although I also did them w/o the first loop around AA and I
was still recovering from the quad.

This is 14.5 seconds slower than last year, but it was about 10F
warmer.  I also had to start from a dead stop, on my first interval
(although I started slightly before the top of the minute, in theory
to make up for that).  The graph that I get from Movescount does not
look right.  The troughs are not deep enough.  It is quite possible
that my Ambit3's battery is so old that it's really doing
significantly more approximation than it did a year ago.  If so, that
makes a lot of my interval analysis a bit dodgy, but it doesn't really
greatly affect my other trainings since approximations get more
accurate at all the other distance / pace combinations I do.
Furthermore, the battery for my HRM is replaceable and now I'm
replacing it once a month, so my HR shouldn't be too much of an
approximation.

My guess is I'm less than 15 seconds per mile less fit than last year,
but probably not much less.  Assuming I can avoid a potty break (4
minutes last year!) and assuming my snail's pace at the end of BMDM
last year was due to my pack breaking, I should be around 10 minutes
faster (all else equal, and it probably won't be, because it should be
hotter) than last year, but probably not fifteen minutes faster.

Ugh.  First interval 5.7 seconds per mile slower than a week ago,
second 1.7 secondds slower.  It was warmer this week, I started
further down the road and my pack may have been a pound higher.  I had
put a little extra weight in my pack for King of The Hill, which I
didn't take out before adding a 5 pound bag of rice to my pack today.
My scale has so much variance that I am not 100% confident that my
pack was a pound higher than last week, but that's both what the scale
read and it also makes sense.

Overall, considering the swelling and discomfort in my right foot, I'm
happy I didn't go backward further, but considering I'm on my taper, I
expected to show improvement over last week.  Last year my first two
intervals were 8.9 and 2.9 seconds faster.

Without a pack

This was after 3 AA loops (i.e., I jogged 11.5 miles before starting
my intervals).  I haven't done that in a while.  It was also w/o any
calories other than the small amount in the espressos I had.

I had some sort of respiratory sickness that kept me from training
March 27th - 30th.  The symptoms were suspiciously like a mild case of
Covid-19, but I couldn't be tested and there are so few confirmed
instances of Covid-19 in Bernalillo County that my guess is it was
something else.  Anyway, my lungs are not back to normal, but I'm
doing OK, considering.

My right foot is still in distress, which is why I chose to do my
interval training today without a pack.  I'll do a pack half marathon
at a 130bpm HR on Wednesday.

I'm on my 1/4 distance taper, since I have the Tough Ruck/Boston
Marathon substitute coming up.  Today I should have done 3 intervals
with my pack, but it was raining and I didn't want to get the contents
of my pack wet, so I ran w/o a pack.  Then it snowed and I could have
run with the pack, but I didn't know it would snow,

I screwed up when I ran and only did 15 seconds of rest after my first
interval.  I didn't realize I had only rested 15 seconds when I did my
second interval and consequently I went 15 seconds longer than I
should have *and* I was slowing down tremendously as I went.

My timing was off enough that my app that extracts my interval info
can't even find 3 intervals.  I could change the constraints it uses
to find them, but there's no point.  I don't have anything to compare
them to.  As it is, I rarely run 3 intervals (2 up, 1 down) and when I
do, it's often with a pack.

So, I probably got some acceptable training in today, considering that
I'm on my taper.  I also put less stress on my right foot by running
without my pack.  The substitute runs that are coming up are pretty
much one-offs anyway, so the exact details of what I'm doing now don't
really matter anyway.

By now JMTR50M has been canceled.  In theory SJS50M and HR100M still
might go, but my guess is they'll both be canceled.

Lungs still pretty fried.  I half-assed it today.  I don't think I
could have even started running if I thought I had to really go all
out.  At least I should be able to do better next week w/o much
effort, although I'll be taking my truck into Affordable Automotive
and may not do my normal Monday exercise.

Pretty poor, however, better than the end of last month, and I did
ride my bike 100 miles yesterday.  Furthermore, I ran 11.6 miles
before doing my intervals (i.e. from my house and 3 and a fraction
laps around Albuquerque Academy).

However, last year I rode the Santa Fe Century the day before and also
ran 3 and a fraction laps, and I was 16 seconds per mile faster.  Of
course I hadn't had a nasty lung infection a month prior (and it
appears to have been slightly cooler).

So, it's no surprise that I was more fit last year, but considering
how bad I was previously, I'm pretty happy.  I also tanked hard
starting in about June, so if I can avoid that, I'll go into my
Hardrock taper in better shape than I would have last year.

About a second faster per mile than two weeks ago, but the remarkable
thing about a dancing pig is not that he dances well, it's that he
dances at all.  I doubt many of the other RG2C finishers did interval
training today.

FWIW, I did screw up my stats by misremembering when my 3rd interval
was to end.  I wound up jogging 15 seconds before the end, then
noticed my mistake and briefly sped up again.  Still, that mistake was
a fraction of 1/12th of my workout, so it didn't really screw things
up that much.

My pace for the entire 15.66 miles was 10:30, but my average HR was
125.  Two weeks ago my pace for 15.66 miles was 10:22, but my average
HR was 131.  It was also slightly hotter this week, so overall I'd say
I'm *slightly* more fit than I was then.

Without a pack.  Yesterday I did some pack work since it was Run as
One and I also went to La Cueva track with Margaret in the afternoon.
To top it off, my poker work cost me an hour of sleep last night, so
I'm fairly happy with the progress here, although last week I had done
the RG2C the day before my intervals.

Pathetic showing today, although that's what I expected. I have not
slept well the last couple of nights and my rest bike ride yesterday
took more out of me than it should.  My right foot is still slightly
injuired, so I decided to skip 9.9 miles of running before the
intervals, just do the intervals and then get home, which is what I
did.

Since I knew I was only going to do a single lap, I didn't bring any
water bottles.  That meant I didn't have my normal cue to keep track
of which lap I was on.  So, I botched and took only 15 seconds of rest
between my 3rd and 4th interval and accidentally took 45 seconds
between my 11th and 12th interval. I also wound up doing 13 intervals.

FWIW, I'm glad I did them.  The Silverton Alpine 50k is coming up soon
enough that I need to know where my right foot stands (pardon the
pun).

No pack.  1/2 distance taper, although I did my intervals before doing
half of my non-interval distance.  This is similar to what I did the
last time I did a 1/2 distance taper, except then (March 2nd) I did
have a pack and I also made up the extra distance (between 5.6 and
6.55) back in the neighborhood in March (pre covid-19).

So, I really don't have anything to compare this directly to.  My
second interval is incredibly slow.  Looking at a graph of my pace
during it shows a weird decline in the middle which I don't remember.
The jagginess of the graph makes me think I'm seeing some anomalies
due to the age of m watch (specifically the age of the battery built
in).

Looks like I first used my Ambit3 on October 8th, 2014, so my watch is
five and a half years old.

Anyway, considering the fact that I did a cheater double-crossing on
Saturday with a slightly gimpy right foot, I'm happy.  A week from
today I'll do 1/4 distance and incorporate 3 intervals, then I'll
drive Margaret and myself up to Silverton.  Whee!

Absolutely pitiful numbers, but at least I ran all 12.

I left the house not knowing what I was going to do and without
drinking any extra water beforehand or taking water with me.  I chose
to run only one lap (instead of two laps) around AA before doing my
intervals and I wasn't even sure as I was finishing the first lap
whether I'd do any intervals, then I talked myself into doing at least
one ... which led to all twelve.

My right foot is still pretty jacked up from the Baldy 50k.  It did
not feel good during any of my running and after I had finished my
laps I stopped running along Barstow, took my shoes off and walked
barefoot the rest of the way home.  Typing this up my foot is really
complaining, so I'm not sure what I'll do the rest of the week.

Without a pack.  Worst stats in a long time, because I half-assed it.
However, today was the first day I ran 13.1 miles w/o stopping since
Baldy 50k, which really trashed my right foot.  I went into today's
run choosing to prioritize distance going w/o walking over doing my
intervals.  In fact, I was willing to not do intervals *at all* if I
needed to forego them in order to get my run done without walking, so
half-assing them was a compromise.

No pack. Ran out to AA, 2 laps around AA, did intervals during the
3rd, then did a 4th, for 15.6 miles total.  However, after my second
interval I was lost in thought and rested longer than I should have.
I realized what I had done, but I chose to rest 1:30 instead of 0:30
so that all the other start and stop times would be correct (i.e., I
start on the 0, then the 45, then the 30, then the 15).

So, my average of 7:36.4 for ten intervals isn't fair because it
doesn't include the first two intervals which were uphill.  I still
think I got a great workout; I just can't use this weeks numbers as
part of my analysis.

The nice thing is that it was cool enough that I had extra water which
allowed me to run 15.6 instead of 13.1.  I wouldn't have done that if
my foot weren't better, either.  It's still not 100%, but it's moving
in that direction.

No pack.  I screwed up and started my third interval 15 seconds early.
I then took an extra 15 second pause between my third and fourth lap
to get back in sync.  I don't *think* that shift of 15 seconds helped
me.  My guess is it harmed my stats, but not very much.

No pack.  My intervals were better than they look because I started
significantly early.  I knew the north facing AA gate was closed, so when
I saw my seconds were about to tick over to 00 I started my first interval
before crossing the AA driveway (which is where I normally start from).

That means I had more uphill overall and all that uphill was at the
beginning.  I also had to dodge a vehicle that was in the right lane
when I was about to cross the west facing AA road.  I didn't know if
he wanted to turn right, so I went out to the bike lane and ran to the
left of him, but it turns out he wanted to be in the left-most lane.
Ugh.

Additionally, I ran out of water by the end, which wasn't a big deal
from a hydration POV, because it was relatively cool, but it did mean
that I didn't have the cue of a bottle with liquid in it that I could
shift from hand to hand at the end to know whether I was on an odd or
even interval.

FTR, I ran fasted this morning, and had 3 tablespoons of chia in 20
oz. as my first water bottle and then 4 scoops of Tailwind (I think! I
may have only used three) in my second bottle.  I think that works out
fine when I'm only doing 13.1 miles.

No pack.  Two days ago was a mostly self-supported Mt. Taylor 50k.
The race was canceled due to covid, but a bunch of people went out and
played on the mountain that day.  I chose to do the full course in the
normal direction, but started a half hour early with Bobby Keogh.
Ken, Margaret and others had marked all the turns to the Continental
Divide Trail, and I stayed with Bobby until we reached it, however
after we split up, we both wound up getting of course.  I wound up
bushwhacking it over some gnarly terrain to get back to rock tank.

Anyway, I took yesterday off, and although I did intervals today, I
had no oomph.  Not too surprising.  It was still nice to get out and
do them.  My overall time for 13.1 miles was slightly faster than last
week, but part of that had to do with it being cooler and me also not
stopping to chat with anyone.
