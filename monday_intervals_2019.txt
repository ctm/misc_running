Without pack, but after a morning where I ran 1 AA lap then back to
the house to poop, then came back and ran an AA lap and an extra mile
before running the intervals.  All told I wound up doing 15.42 miles
(close to my new normal 15.50 Monday miles), with the intervals as the
first part of my final AA lap.  My GI distress was due to a
combination of me doing a low fiber Saturday in preparation for Run
for the Zoo on Sunday as well as celebratory eating and drinking after
RFTZ.

The funny thing is that @ RFTZ, my average pace was 7:25 according to
my Ambit 3 (and 7:27 according to the chip timing), which basically
shows that by doing my intervals when I'm doing them (i.e., as my
fourth and final AA lap), I'm probably not getting anywhere near as
fast as I would if I were doing them after a brief warm-up on a day
after a rest day.  OTOH, I don't think faster intervals are as
important as high volume for HR, but I do think the intervals help.

Without pack, and only the second time I've done my intervals at the
end of a 15.5 mile run, even though that has been my *intent* for the
last few weeks (pooping has gotten in the way).  Today was my fastest
15.5 miles @ *approximately* 130bpm so far.  The whole thing averaged
9:21 min/mi, 132bpm.

So, although I only improved by .7 seconds a mile, my legs had more
immediate mileage on them before starting the intervals than ever
before.  I also wound up starting *right* on the road into the east
entrance to AA (i.e. I started as far west as I ever do, which meant
slightly more uphill).  OTOH, compared to last week it was cooler
simply because I got to the intervals earlier in the day.  It was not,
however, particularly cool.

Kind of hard to interpret today's intervals, because I doubled up on
the caffeine and didn't have breakfast.  I chose to do it that way
because I ate weird yesterday due to the Santa Fe Century and ate
weird the day before due to the SAR mission and ate weird the day
before that due to ESCAPE.  This morning I was really afraid I
wouldn't be able to do my entire run w/o having to return for a potty
break, but I figured if I skipped breakfast, and then had a second
dose of caffeine and waited around, I might be able to get through it,
and I did.

The weather was slightly (1.5F on average) cooler than last week, but
there was more humidity in the air.  I think the extra humidity was
cooling, but it's hard for me to say.  Normally my "big" weekend
effort is on a Saturday and I relax by riding my bike on Sunday.  This
past weekend, my "big" effort *was* a bike ride and it was on Sunday,
so my legs didn't have the extra day to recover, but I did not ride my
bike anywhere nearly as hard as most of my big Saturday efforts.

My second hand hit a fifteen second start a little later than last
week, so I started slightly further uphill.  I haven't previously
tried to analyze how much of a difference that makes, but when I took
a poke just now it appears that the logging granularity is too course
for me to get a feel for how much time or distance elapsed.

Oh, and I didn't sleep particularly well last night due to the
caffeine and perhaps even a little due to the jalapenos I ate as part
of my post-ride meal @ SFC.

These were done on a Friday, because I didn't run on Monday due to
still being tired from JMTR50M.  I didn't do intervals on Wednesday,
because I chose to do a speed 5k pack run in preparation for the
Believe in Heroes ruck 5k, but I used my Trekker and wasn't really
able to run as fast as I should have due to bad resonance.  So, my
compromise was to do 12 intervals on Friday (the day before BiH5k),
but in the middle of a 5.6 mile (i.e., from home, to AA, one lap
around AA and back) 35# pack run, using George's pack, which I also
borrowed for BiH.

Forgot to have breakfast, even though that was my tentative plan for
today.  Chose to take a double espresso to have after my second AA
loop, so it would have about a half hour to kick in before I started
my intervals.  A guy driving out of AA didn't immediately stop at the
stop sign even though I was running right toward him.  He saw me and
suddenly slammed on his brakes (and luckily didn't get rear-ended; my
guess is the person behind him saw me), but that prevented me from
starting my interval when/where I had planned, so I waited for the
next increment of 15 seconds to hit before I started.

Today was *hot* (74.5F when I finally got home).  I had to ration my
chia-seed water.  I think skipping breakfast probably held me back,
especially since I went down 1.7 pounds from yesterday morning to this
morning in part due to my messed up eating schedule due to me
misremembering when the Team RWB Leadership meeting was being held.

I expected to make gains, considering I didn't really do much over the
weekend (although I do admit that BiH was intense, even though brief),
but today was the first Monday where it started out warm and sunny and
just got warmer.  When doing 11.5 miles before my first interval, heat
is probably a big factor.  My guess is my body got some good stress
though and will make some useful adaptations.

Big change this week.  Did intervals before any laps around AA, then
chose not to do any more laps around AA.  W/o Hardrock looming, I'm
de-emphasizing mileage and trying to up speed and heat tolerance.

I accidentally ran my 8th interval for only 60 seconds, so the 6:55.3
is much slower because it includes fifteen seconds of rest.  It was a
downhill interval, so it should have been closer to 6:25.  However,
that means that my intervals after that were all done in a slightly
less taxed state, so I can't just subtract 2.5 seconds (30 seconds /
12 intervals) off my overall average.

FWIW, when I run my interval averaging app against my July 2nd, 2018
GPX file I get "Average: 7:06.7", which is more than a couple seconds
per mile slower than what I hand calculated last year (7:04) and gives
me a three second per mile improvement over last year.  However, there
were four notable differences between last year's run and today's:

  1) I had run a lap around AA last year before I did my intervals
  2) It was slightly cooler last year
  3) I only had one hand-held last year
  4) The day before I did a two hour leisurely bike ride, rather than
     a relatively tough one hour ruck run.

Bottom line is I don't think today's interval training shows that I'm
significantly more or less fit than I was one year ago.

Today's interval training started after one AA lap. I didn't have any
non-caffeine calories before or during, and it was muggy, although a
fairly consistent 75F.

I'm in a rush, so this is the output from int_ave as I left it last time
I was experimenting with it.  The fudges that I've removed don't change
the paces, but they can change which 75-second spans were chosen as
intervals.

TODO: use fantoccini to scrape all the dates that I mention in this file
and then run a "good" version of int_ave over all of them.

Ugh.  Worst intervals in a long time.  I hope that's due to me doing them in
a fasted state, but still these stats are horrible.

Decided to do intervals on a Wednesday, two days after previous
intervals.  I'm going to try this next week, too.  I would normally be
doing pack runs on Wednesday but I haven't even sent my Rucker 20L
back yet, and I'm still recovering (I think) from some hip issues.
Anyway, today was a small step up from two days ago, which is pretty
good since I didn't sleep well last night (repeated SAR calls, but I
can't attend the mission due to my truck being in the shop) and my
late start and the consequent heat.

My training since the beginning of June has been pretty poor.  I know
I've been embarrassed by my injuries and performance, *but* I did
manage to BQ @ Cottonwood. Furthermore, this many days after BQ'ing @
Tucson in December 2017, I had a bunch of junk in my lungs from either
a bad cold or the flu.  So in one respect I'm doing much better than
last time.

My interval stats two days ago were absolutely horrible, although
IIRC, I started off on the wrong foot (so to speak) by running my
first interval longer than 75 seconds and then simply shortening my 30
second rest.  So, it's nice to see significant improvement two days
later, but 7:42 is still pretty bad.  Last year, the Monday before
Mt. Taylor 50k, I was at 7:11, and I ran the entire 13.1 mile training
run at a 9:45 min/mile pace @ 130bpm.  Today, the 13.1 was 11:16
min/mile @ 130bpm.

I don't think I'm fit enough to want to enlist a pacer or crew to help
me beat 20 hours @ JJ100 this year.  After getting close last year w/o
crew and pacer I figured I could simply knock the eleven minutes off
my time by adding support, but now the race is close enough that I
think that it's an unrealistic goal and that I should simply be happy
with whatever time I get and just take it easy to be as recovered as
possible going into BMDM training in mid November.

These 10/21 stats aren't that good, but I did run the Duke City
Marathon as the five hour pace group leader (in 5:00:19) yesterday and
did "run" the Sandia Crossing Marathon (5,600 ft. gain, dodgy footing,
higher altitude and I stopped to chat with people and to drink a pint
of beer) the day before in 7:24:30.  Last year my average was 7:10.5
the day after DCM, which was the day after the White Mesa Fat Ass 50k
(which I ran in 6:45:54, but only had 4,600 ft. gain, fairly good
footing and no distractions).

I'm definitely not as fit as I was a year ago. I should, however, be
able to run JJ100 sub-24 w/o any distress.  I think going sub-20 is
exceedingly unlikely, although it does look like it might be a
relatively cool year.  I don't think sub-20 is sufficiently doable to
merit trying to scare up a crew and one or more pacers, especially
with me being on a tight budget, so I'll have to leave that for next
year.

========================================================================
Today I chose to run my intervals within only one AA lap, so all told I
ran 5.56 miles instead of 13.1.  Last year on the Wednesday between DCM
and JJ100 I didn't run at all, because of a combination of the weather and
my catching a flight to PHX.  I wanted to do more speed work today, but
decided 13.1 miles was perhaps a bit too much this close to JJ100.

Unfortunately, I forgot when I was supposed to stop running on my 
eleventh interval, so I in between a 7:51 and a 7:40 I posted an 8:20.
To make up for it, I ran 13 intervals total (deliberately this time).

So, even w/o the extra 3.3 miles before, I'm still not particularly
fast when doing my intervals, but I believe at this point it's
basically due to the fitness that I lost when I was injured rather the

Last year, my average was 6:54.2 on the Monday after Deadman Peaks 53
miler, so I'm 28.6 seconds slower than last year, which isn't
suprising but is a little annoying.  Oh well, at least I have plenty
of room for improvement.

========================================================================
Was 8 seconds past the top of the minute when I crossed the earliest
spot I start my intervals.  Decided to jog for 52 seconds uphill
instead of only 7, so I started at :00 instead of :15.  That helped me
remember when to start, rest and stop, but it did give me less uphill
which surely helped my stats.

FWIW, my interval stats are better than a year ago, but in addition to
the shorter uphill, last year I ran the Ghost Town 50k the day before
my intervals, rather than the WMFA 50 two days before.

The big experiment is coming up in that I'm going to alternate pack
and non-pack intervals starting my first pack intervals of the
training season a week from today.  Last year I switched to pack
intervals every Monday while in the serious portion of my BMDM
training and I think that was too much.

Today was my first 40# 13.1 mile interval training since February
25th.  I experimented with having three slices of bread instead of
oatmeal pre-run, but then I spilled some cous-cous in our bread
cabinet and while cleaning it I found a few old stale small tortillas,
both corn and flour, so ... I ate them.  Then, right before leaving I
decided to have two gels.  I don't think I gained any power or stamina
by all of that.  I suspect I lost some speed, however, the valve on my
bladder didn't work, so after I went through my first two 20
oz. bottles of water, I couldn't get more water, so I was parched at
the end, especially with the temperature getting up to 55.8F at the
end.

So, last year, 2018_11_19: Average: 8:14.7
               2019_02_25: Average: 7:54.4

Being down 21.2 seconds/mile from last year at this time isn't
horrible, considering how much fitness I lost due to injury in my
off-season, especially considering the temperature difference (last
year the average by my Ambit3 was 51.6F, this year 61.9F, although
that could be skewed by my lack of water slowdown at the end).

It will be interesting to see if the various tweaks I make during this
year's training will allow me to catch up to where I was last year by
race day.

Done without a pack. This is my best time since June 3rd (technically,
I ran faster intervals on July 1st, but I didn't run as far before I
started the intervals, so it doesn't count), although it's only
slightly better than 11/11, and on both that day and today I started
fairly high up the hill due to needing to get to :00 to start.

I walked with Roy a bunch of time after I had done my intervals, so my
overall 13.1 mile time wasn't particularly quick, but my first 9 miles
averaged a 9:08 pace, which is pretty good.

Still, I'm hoping to get back under 7:00 as I continue my BMDM
training.

I chose not to run at all Monday 12/2/2019.  I had a quad espresso in
the morning, but that didn't really wake me up.  The Bosque Boogie 50k
took *much* more out of me than I expected.  Slipping and sliding as
well as carrying around a bunch of extra mud (weight!) on the bottom
of my shoes wound up using muscles in different amounts than normal.
I'm not the most efficient runner by any means, but I'm still *much*
more efficient when running that course mud-free than I was on
Saturday.

Oh yeah, and I fell and hit the ground once during that run, too.  I
think I tripped on the same stump I did last year (or the year
before).  It's toward the end of the first loop, right as we have to
go slightly to the left before we have to go under the Montano bridge.
There's about a four inch diameter stump that sticks up about an inch
that is easy to overlook when the sun is still in the east. *MAYBE*
I'll remember it next year.

I still felt guilty not running on Monday, but at least I don't appear
to be getting a cold, and my Wednesday (12/4) speed pack run went
fairly well.

========================================================================
Ugh!  I wound up getting called out on a SAR mission last night and my
pack got completely discombobulated, in part due to proper use but
also due to me losing my keys and then pulling everything out of it.
Furthermore, lots of stuff got wet slightly because I made a mistake
with the Jet Boil and introduced a tiny amount of snow into my pack,
but mostly because I volunteered to lug the subject's frozen pants and
frozen shoes in my pack.  So ...

... I got back home, brought everything in from the Sienna, had
breakfast and a very strong beer and decided to count my SAR mission
as my exercise, even though it was only vaguely comparable.
========================================================================
Without a pack and on a Tuesday after core exercises, but with only
one bottle of water and only a half a brick of tempeh and a green
drink as calories since 5pm yesterday evening.

Tuesdays are supposed to be rest days, where I only run 8.9 miles at a 130bpm
HR, but due to the SAR mission I missed doing intervals yesterday which made
two weeks in a row, so I decided to compromise and run 8.9 miles but add my
intervals to it.  Since it was only going to be 8.9, I chose not to run with
calories in my water, but once I had done my second lap I decide that if I
felt good after doing my intervals I'd run the third lap and the loop around
the block that brings it up to 13.1, which is what I did.  My average HR was
135 after doing intervals so rather than run super slowly to try to bring my
total average HR to 130, I chose to run faster than normal to see if I could
finish my 13.1 with an average pace faster than 8:00 min/mi, which I did:

13.12 miles, 1:57:12.5, 8:56 min/mi, 137bpm average HR

At this point I think I'll do all my 13.1 mile or less non-pack runs w/o
calories, but I'll still use calories on my pack runs.

Since today was not a pack run interval training session, I'll use my
pack a this coming Monday.  Normally I don't do that after a Bosque
Bike Path Saturday pack run, but due to a Cibola SAR evaluation, I'm
doing my Bosque Bike Path pack run this Friday anyway.

Although these are my best numbers since 10/15/2018, I did start
further up the hill than most times.  I crossed the driveway across
Albuquerque Academy at about 8 seconds after the top of the minute.
There was too much sun and traffic for me to have tried to hurry
across fast enough to start a minute earlier, so I ran *very* slowly
those 52 seconds to the top of the minute, but that still put me
further up the hill.

Oh, my rest between intervals 10 and 11 was 45 seconds instead of 30
due to a stoplight at the western entrance to AA.  I made up for it by
taking only a 15 second rest between intervals 11 and 12.

========================================================================

With 40# pack.  Was supposed to be 13.1 miles, but I had to cut it
short *after* I did my intervals, due to potentially explosive GI
distress.  Nice improvement over 11/18, especially since I'm getting
over a bad cold or mild flu.  My suspicion is that my GI distress was
due to the residual effects of my sickness, although the way I
staggered my caffeine may have contributed, too.

Last year on 12/17, my average 8:03.4, but I had a chest cold.  Today
I had very little in my lungs and basically felt great, but as
recently as Thursday evening I skipped two social activities due to
sickness and my Friday 18 mile 40# pack run was definitely slower due
to sickness, so ... I'm happy with the progress I'm making and hope I
can sustain my momentum.

Oh, and I started further down the hill than usual, *before* the AA
driveway.  I normally don't start my intervals that early, but there
was no traffic and I didn't want to travel up hill for almost a minute
before starting.  So that makes my stats a little better than they
appear.
